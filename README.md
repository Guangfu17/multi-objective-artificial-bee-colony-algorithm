# multi-objective-artificial-bee-colony-algorithm
This project introduces a multiobjective artificial bee colony algorithm based on decomposition.

MOEADABC.m is the algorithm.

Here are the parameters:   
population size  N  
number of objectives  M  
number of variables  D  
lower bound of each decision variable  lower  
upper bound of each decision variable  upper  
algorithm function  algorithm  
problem function  problem  
encoding of the problem  encoding  
number of evaluated individuals  evaluated  
maximum number of evaluations  evaluation  
current generation  gen  
maximum generation  maxgen  
run number  run  
runtime  runtime  
number of saved populations  save  
set of saved populations  result  
true Pareto front  PF
